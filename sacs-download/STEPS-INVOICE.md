# Invoice data download — steps as taught by Dixon (2026-07-20)

Same unit loop and same save location as PO — only the report and the form
differ. See `STEPS-PO.md` for the unit loop and `UNIT-MAP.md` for destinations.

## Where to find it

**Reports → Finance → Vendor Invoice Report**

(PO was under Material Management › Miscellaneous. Invoice is under **Finance**.)

The Finance › report submenu also lists: Goods Received Not Invoiced (GRNI),
Posted Vendor Invoice Reconciliation, Stock Revaluation, Transferred Purchase
Orders, Invoice Change Log, Sales Invoice Posting, Export KPI data… — we want
**Vendor Invoice Report**.

## 🔑 Invoice is downloaded at MASTER level (opposite of PO)

Dixon, 2026-07-20. PO loops operating units and skips MASTER. **Invoice does the
reverse** — the Vendor Invoice Report at master level already aggregates every
unit, so one download = the whole country.

| Country | Download from unit | File | Level |
|---------|--------------------|------|-------|
| UK | **UK-MASTER** | `UK-<Mon>-<YYYY>.csv` | master |
| CH | **CH-MASTER** | `CH-<Mon>-<YYYY>.csv` | master |
| IRL | **IRL-MASTER** | `IRL-<Mon>-<YYYY>.csv` | master |
| NL | **EU-MASTER** ⚠️ | `NL-<Mon>-<YYYY>.csv` | EU master (special!) |
| SE | SE-ARN 3056 · SE-GOT 3057 · SE-MMX 3058 | `SE,<UNIT>-<Mon>-<YYYY>.csv` | per unit — **no master** |
| NO | NO-OSL 3052 · NO-BGO 3053 | `NO,<UNIT>-<Mon>-<YYYY>.csv` | per unit — **no master** |
| DK | (per unit) | `DK,<UNIT>-...` | per unit — **no master** |

⚠️ **SE, NO, DK have NO master level** — they must be done per operating unit,
**one at a time** (Dixon, 2026-07-20). Only UK/CH/IRL/NL have a master to pull
the whole country from.

**8 downloads per month** (4 country masters + SE ×3 + NO ×2), not one per unit.

Filename convention (from newest existing files): full month name + 4-digit
year, e.g. `CH-Jan-2026.csv`, `UK-Dec-2025.csv`; per-unit uses a **comma**:
`SE,ARN-Jan-2026.csv`, `NO,BGO-Jan-2026.csv`.

Date range = **the whole previous month** (Date From `01/MM/YYYY`, Date To =
last day). Confirmed by Dixon.

Save to `...\Data_EU_Master_Channel\Invoice Level Data\UK_SACS\` — add files
only; never touch what is already there.

## Backfill outstanding (as of 2026-07-20)

Newest existing = **Jan 2026** (filed 2026-02-19). Missing months:
**Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun 2026** (5 months). 8 downloads × 5 months = 40 files.

## The form

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| ＊Date From | start of the period (`DD/MM/YYYY`) |
| ＊Date To | end of the period (`DD/MM/YYYY`) |
| Include Non-Inventory Orders | ☐ **unticked** (default) |
| Include All Vendors | ☑ **ticked** (default) |
| | → **Export** |

**Difference from PO:** invoice uses a **date range (From / To)**, not a single
month. (Dixon will confirm exactly which range each month — likely the previous
whole month.)

## Confirmed field IDs (from live inspect, 2026-07-20)

Report URL: `/<prefix>/Reports/DashBoard/VendorInvoiceReport`

| Field | Selector | Set to |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Date From | `#FromPeriod` | `01/MM/YYYY` |
| Date To | `#ToPeriod` | last day of month, `DD/MM/YYYY` |
| Include Non-Inventory Orders | `#IsIncludeNonInvOrders` | leave **unticked** |
| Include All Vendors | `#IsIncludeAllVendors` | leave **ticked** |
| Export | `#ExportVendorInvoiceReport` (an `<a>`) | click |
| Refresh job status | `#refereshJobStatus` (button) | click to poll |
| Job grid | `#JobStatusViewGrid` | download link appears here when done |

## ⚠️ Export is ASYNCHRONOUS (unlike PO)

PO downloads the instant you click Export. Invoice does **not** — clicking
Export creates a **job**. The page has a **"Job status"** grid
(columns: JOB TYPE · STATUS · USER · CREATE DATE · DOWNLOAD REPORT) and a
**Refresh** button. Flow:

1. Click Export → a job appears in the grid.
2. Click **Refresh** until STATUS shows done.
3. Download from the **DOWNLOAD REPORT** column of that row.

So the automation must: submit, then poll the job grid until the row is ready,
then click its download link — not just wait for an immediate download.

## Save location (Dixon, 2026-07-20) — DIFFERENT from PO

```
C:\Users\DChoi\OneDrive - Gategroup\PMO Procurement Europe - Documents\Data_EU_Master_Channel\Invoice Level Data\UK_SACS\
```

⚠️ This is the **PMO/SharePoint** tree, NOT `Documents\Spend\Invoice Level Data`.

- `UK_SACS` is a **folder** (odd name — leave it, don't rename).
- Existing files inside are named `<Country>-<Mon>-<Year>.csv`, e.g.
  `CH-Jun-2025.csv`, `CH-Jan-2026.csv`, `IRL-Apr-25.csv`, plus
  `CH_ALL_UNIT-Oct-25.csv`. Mixed year formats (`-25` vs `-2025`).
- Sibling folders `DE_P71`, `DK and SE P07`, `EOS_IT` are other systems — leave.

**Dixon's instructions:** keep everything already there unchanged; do not rename
or move anything; I MAY create country-level and unit-level subfolders inside,
and add new files. Never alter the originals.

⚠️ Invoice is currently saved at **country level** (one file per country/month),
not per unit — Dixon: "I didn't do unit level because I'm lazy; you can do that
for me." So the target structure to build is
`UK_SACS\<country>\<unit>\...` — TBC exactly with Dixon.

## Reading a job + downloading it (confirmed 2026-07-20)

Each job row exposes:
- **View Criteria** — `gg.sacs.jobStatus.showCriteria(<jobId>)` opens a popup with
  `FromPeriod`, `ToPeriod`, `SelectedUnits`, `IncludeNonInvOrders`,
  `IncludeAdditionalOrders`, `MasterUnitId`, `vendorInfoId`, `JobId`.
- **Download** (Complete jobs only) — an `<a title="Download Report">` whose
  onclick is `downloadReport("Vendor Invoice Report_<stamp>.csv", "<unc path>")`.
  Clicking it (with a Playwright download handler) saves the CSV.

Statuses seen: `In Queue`, `Complete`, `Failed`. The grid is **per unit** and
keeps history (other users' jobs show too).

## ✅ FIRST STEP EVERY TIME: check before submitting (Dixon's rule)

> "First thing first is to check has it been downloaded before; if yes, just
> download that one."

Before submitting any invoice job, scan the unit's grid for a COMPLETE job
(anyone's) whose criteria match the whole month needed (see match rule below).
If one exists, **download it** — do not submit. Only submit + wait when no
matching completed job is found. `scan-available.js` does this scan and writes
`reusable-jobs.json`.

**Scan on 2026-07-20:** nothing reusable for Feb–Jun 2026 across any of the 10
units — all must be self-generated. (Logic checked: UK's only completed job was
RPerisic's 01–14 July, a partial month, correctly rejected.)

## Reuse other people's completed jobs (Dixon's idea)

The grid shows colleagues' jobs. A completed job — anyone's — is **reusable
instead of submitting our own** IF its criteria match exactly:

- `FromPeriod` = `01/MM/YYYY 00:00`
- `ToPeriod` = last day of that month
- `IncludeNonInvOrders` = false
- `IncludeAdditionalOrders` = false
- `vendorInfoId` = 0 (all vendors)
- right `MasterUnitId` / unit

⚠️ **Must check the criteria first.** Example: a UK completed job by RPerisic was
`FromPeriod 2026-07-01 → ToPeriod 2026-07-14` — a *partial* month, so NOT
reusable. Matching the criteria is what makes reuse safe; download-and-hope is
not. If no matching completed job exists, submit our own and wait.

## ⚠️ The queue limit is GLOBAL = 5 (corrected)

**Correction (Dixon, 2026-07-20):** the 5-job limit is **shared across ALL
units** — only 5 jobs total can be pending in SACS at once, not 5 per unit.

I initially misread it as per-unit and submitted UK's 5 (which queued fine,
ids 2638092–2638097), then fired 45 more across the other units — **all 45
bounced with a red "Maximum Queue Reached. Please wait for queue to process."
toast and did NOT queue.** The toast is an in-page notification, not a JS
dialog, so the first script didn't catch it and wrongly logged all 50. The log
was corrected back to the 5 real UK jobs, and the submitter now detects the
toast, refuses to log, and stops.

**Correct workflow:** submit up to 5 → **wait** for SACS to process them →
download the completed ones (which frees queue slots) → submit the next up-to-5.
Repeat. Jobs take up to ~1h. So the backfill runs in rounds of 5, over time.

Only UK Feb–Jun 2026 is actually queued right now.

## 🐛 Orchestrator bug found + stopped (2026-07-20)

`backfill-invoice.js` was launched but **stopped after it re-submitted UK Feb
and Mar** — months already queued. Root cause: the per-job **criteria read
(`readJobs`) is not reliably returning the month**, so:
- completed jobs are not harvested (no month match), and
- already-queued months are not detected → duplicates submitted.

**This same bug probably made `scan-available.js` report "nothing reusable"** —
that result is suspect until the criteria read is fixed and re-run.

**Do not re-launch the orchestrator until `readJobs` criteria parsing is fixed
and verified** (the popup likely needs longer to populate / a more specific
selector / guaranteed close between reads). No damage done — the extra UK jobs
just produce duplicate reports.

## Still to confirm (Dixon continuing later)

- [ ] Exact date range each month (previous whole month? `01` → last day?)
- [ ] The downloaded filename (PO's is `ReceivedPurchaseOrders.csv`)
- [ ] Final filename convention (existing: `<Country>-<Mon>-<Year>.csv`)
- [ ] Country level only, or per-unit as Dixon now wants?
- [ ] Invoice CSV vs xlsx (UK folder had `11.25.csv`; PMO folder has `.csv`)
- [ ] How long the async job typically takes
